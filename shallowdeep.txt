Copying Basics:

Copying refers to creating a duplicate of an object to work with, without modifying the original.
Python provides two main methods for copying: shallow copy and deep copy.
Shallow Copy:

Shallow copy creates a new object but doesn't create copies of nested objects.
It copies the top-level structure and references of the original object.
The copy module's copy() function or object-specific methods like list.copy() can be used for shallow copying.
Deep Copy:

Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects referenced by the original.
It ensures that nested objects are also duplicated, creating an independent copy.
The copy module's deepcopy() function is used for deep copying.
